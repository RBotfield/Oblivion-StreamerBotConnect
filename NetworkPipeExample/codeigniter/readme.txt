This is an example of using CodeIgniter to control the game using the Network Plugin.

The "application" was built against version 2.1.3 of CodeIgniter. 

To install download CodeIgniter and install on your websever/desktop.  Then copy this in place of the application directory.

There are no security measures in this code.  You are responsible for the security of any websites you build.  For the most part this is a default CodeIgniter install.  I have added jquery and made some tweaks to options to get things working.

Included is a copy of the database used to test this code.
